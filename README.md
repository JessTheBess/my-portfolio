# my-portfolio

<!-- This was my attempt at making a portfolio for myself, that I could use for potential employers. 
This sit is still a work in progress. More will be added at a later date to better showcase my talents and learnings. -->

<!-- This site contains a Header with links to the other parts of the page
    An about me section displaying a photo of myself, my cat, and a little about me.
    There is a projects section displaying previous work with links to GitHub.
    The Contact me section has links to social media and then ways for potential employers to contact me.
    And also includes a footer -->
